		Latitude: It's the thing we are all searching to optimize. The closer we are to the equator,
		the closer we are to the sun, the less extreme cold we have to experience. But how much 
		of a difference does Latitude actually play in relationship to different elements of weather?
	  </p>
	  <p>
		In this website, we take four elements: Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed,
		and analyze their relationship to Latitude. Ideally, we want to live not only in a place with 
		warm weather, but one without much humidity (unless you are an ultra fitness nut, who 
		actually likes the feeling of sweat rolling down their body?), cloudiness (Vitamin D is one of 
		the biggest indicators of happiness, but can only be absorbed if clouds aren't blocking the way
		to the sun), or that high of Wind Speed (it doesn't matter how nice the weather is if you
		can't keep your feet on the ground.)
      </p>
      <p>
		Above, in the top left corner of the page, there are links to a comparisons page, where you 
		can look at data from all of the graphs, as well as a link to the data that was used to 
		generate these charts. In the top right, there is a drop down option where you can click on 
		a link to each graph to examine each scatter chart more carefully. As you examine this data,
		think about why you choose to live where you do. Is it a job? Family? School opportunities? 
		Sunlight? Local produce? As you examine this dataset, think about how each of these elements
		can be effected by the weather, and then further examine our results to see how important 
		Latitude is to these elements.
