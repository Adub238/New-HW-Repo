Cheers!                                                                                                       40\n",

These are generally big bodied with robust flavors, accompanied by fairly high alcohol contents--therefore ideal for tasting on a full stomach. These include Scottish-style ales, cellar beers, and German-style bocks.         9\n",
      "Get toasty while sipping on one of these beers, which are generally dark (brownish reds to nearly black), malty sweet, and chewy. Their robust flavors demand that you savor them, which is okay because these beers do well served cold or warm. These include stouts, porters, and beers with unique flavors like chocolate and coffee.    20\n",
